EndlessWar
GamePanel.java- is the main game class

Instructions:

This is a strategy game called Endless War. Essentially the user tries to defeat the 'Comp' base before they have their base destroyed.
There are three types of troops- each of a different strength and money, and there are three types of turrets that shoot rocks at the
enemy's base. Each troop is also worth a different amount of money and shoots at a corresponding speed. At the end of the game the user 
can choose to submit their name to the file, which is saved to a text file along with the 'Comp' base and their user base scores.

Please enjoy this game... it was meant to be played in a full sitting and not paused or interrupted.

Best of luck and let's hope you have a Stronghold on this game!
